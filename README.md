## 🧠 How to Use the App

> The page lets users explore available colleges based on their JEE Rank and input details. It helps generate a realistic shortlist of seats that have a high probability of getting allotted — based on your rank, past trends, and preferences.

### ✅ My Suggested Workflow:

                Step 1 → Enter your rank and other details (quota, gender, exam type, etc.)

                Step 2 → Download the data for the most recent year

                Step 3 → Remove the college/seat options you're not interested in, and
                add your top personal preferences to the top of the file

                Step 4 → Cross-check the data once online to confirm accuracy
                (there's only so much data cleaning a single man and his AI can do 😅)

                Step 5 → Use this list during your actual counseling and hope for your dream seat
                (IIT Bombay, CSE, right?! 😉)

                Optional → Reorder your preferences based on your personal goals before submitting.
